# My Personal Project

## Purpose

The application will enable the user to:
- add `.txt` and `.md` files from anywhere on their computer  
- give each note a category (which can be hierarchical, say School > Science > Ecology)  
- browse these notes based on their category (so, in the past example, looking at all notes in the ecology category)  
- find desired notes by looking at recently opened notes and searching the note titles  
- open the notes in their default text editor  

It will be used by those who wish to be able to easily find notes about various topics whenever they need them. It will also be handy for those who have a variety of notes but difficulty finding the correct.  
This project is of interest to me since I will personally find it helpful for keeping track of and finding important and handy information. Additionally, I am interested in learning more about how to handle files via code.
