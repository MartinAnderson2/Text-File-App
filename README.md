# My Personal Project

## Purpose

The application will enable the user to:
- add `.txt` files from anywhere on their computer  
- place each note in a folder (which can be hierarchical, say: School > Science > Ecology)  
- browse these notes based on their folder (so, in the past example, looking at all notes in the ecology category)  
- find desired notes by looking at recently-opened notes and searching the note titles  
- open the notes in their default text editor  

It will be used by those who wish to be able to easily find notes about various topics whenever they need them. It will also be handy for those who have a lot of notes but difficulty finding the correct ones when they need them.  
This project is of interest to me since I will personally find it helpful for keeping track of and finding important and handy information. Additionally, I am interested in learning more about how to handle files via code and how to create categories of arbitrary depth.
